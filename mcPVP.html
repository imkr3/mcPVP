<span style="color:2EFF4A;">1.8 PVP doesn't have attack delays so in this version CPS or Clicks Per Second matters a lot<br><br></span>

<span style="color:2EFF6D;">There are many ways of clicking such as butterfly clicking, jitter clicking or drag clicking<br><br></span>

<span style="color:2EFF82;">In PVP you should probably use butterfly or jitter clicking because it's the most consistent out of many clicking methods<br><br></span>

<span style="color:2EFF97;">1.8 PVP also has many techniques such as W-Tap, AD-tap, Hit Selection, Blockhitting and more<br><br></span>

<span style="color:2EFFA5;"><p>In W-tap you should time when you should go forward. The reach distance of players is 3 blocks, so you should try to keep 3 blocks and tap W so you don't get to close to the other player</p></span>

<span style="color:2EFFBA;"><p>In AD-tap, you have to keep holding W while you use A and D to keep moving sideways. This will make the other player harder to aim, <s>while making you a bit faster than walking in a straight line becuase going sideways is a bit faster in Minecraft</s></p></span>

<span style="color:2EFFD6;"><p>Hit Selection is the hardest of all the techniques in this list, so you shouldn't try this until you master the others. So if you want to learn Hit Selection you have to know that in triangles the hypotenuse is longer than other sides of the triangle. To do Hit Selection you have to get hit first, than when you drop down you have to time the hit so the knockback on the other player gets big.</span>
<span style="color:2EFFFF;">When you do that the other player will get knockbacked more making the opponent float in the air. This will make the other player's view farther than 3 blocks making them unable to hit. While you on the other hand is on the ground so you will have to W-tap again so you stay in your area of 3 blocks from the other player</p></span>
